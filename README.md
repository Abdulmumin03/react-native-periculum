## Authentication

To utilize any of Insights endpoints, a public key value is required.

To authenticate against the authorization server, you must ensure that you have received your appâ€™s client public key from Periculum. Without this, your app will be unable to call endpoints on the Insights API. If you have not obtained your client public key, then you should contact Periculum standard support channel (email support@periculum.io).
